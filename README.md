# trilium-theme-lightslategray
A theme for the Trilium note taking application based on the color lightslategray. 

I build it using version 0.37.6 so it might give mixed results on (much) earlier or later versions. 

## Installation
 - Installation of Trilium Notes is required. 
 - copy the content of the of the trilium-theme-lightslategray.css file and paste it in a code note in Trilium.
 - Give it the name you want to use (I suggest lightslategray) and set the code note type to CSS.
 - Add the label attribute appTheme to the note with the value lightslategray (or other name choose). 
 - Go to the options and change the theme to lightslategray
